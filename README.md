Let's make an image gallery/carousel:

Grab a bunch of large but different sized images (preferably of animals)
Build an image gallery/carousel using JavaScript (you're welcome to use some outside libraries too - Bootstrap is cheating!)
You should have at least 3 files - an HTML file, CSS file, and JavaScript file
The user should be able to swap between images easily, but you should also add some functionality for switching to the next image if the user doesn't click anything for a while
The gallery should wrap around on the first/last images
Try to pretty up your gallery and show off your CSS abilities, here are a few (not mandatory!) suggestions: make the gallery/carousel a fixed size and display images inside of it without distorting them; display the images in a grid and when the user clicks on one, it should open a modal which contains the carousel; animations for switching images; anything that improves the UI
You're free to design/implement the gallery however you like
When you're done, throw it up on a Github repo for us to take a look at
Have fun :)
