Image gallery/carousel:

Grabbed a bunch of large but different sized images (preferably of animals)
Built an image gallery/carousel using JavaScript

The user can swap between images easily, or the carousel will switch to the next image if the user doesn't click anything for a while

The gallery wraps around on the first/last images

Some advanced CSS doesn't work perfectly on all browsers, but it should degrade gracefully.

The gallery/carousel has a fixed size and displays images inside of it without distorting them; thumb view displays the images in a grid and when the user clicks on one, it switches to carousel view.
